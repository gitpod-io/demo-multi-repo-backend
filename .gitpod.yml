##
## This '.gitpod.yml' file when placed at the root of a project instructs
## Gitpod how to prepare & build the project, start development environments
## and configure continuous prebuilds. Prebuilds when enabled builds a project
## like a CI server so you can start coding right away - no more waiting for
## dependencies to download and builds to finish when reviewing pull-requests
## or hacking on something new.
##
## With Gitpod you can develop software from any device (even iPads) via 
## desktop or browser based versions of VS Code or any JetBrains IDE and
## customise it to your individual needs - from themes to extensions, you
## have full control.
##
## The easiest way to try out Gitpod is install the browser extenion:
## 'https://www.gitpod.io/docs/browser-extension' or by prefixing
## 'https://gitpod.io#' to the source control URL of any project.
##
## For example: 'https://gitpod.io#https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod'

## The optional 'mainConfiguration' key when defined points to the
## repository with the main `.gitpod.yml` file and makes it possible to open
## the same workspace from any issue, branch or other context URL from any
## repository defined in a multi repository configuration.
